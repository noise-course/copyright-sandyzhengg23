Copyright Assignment

**Platform Analysis:**

YouTube detects copyrighted content mainly through Content ID, an
automated system that scans every upload against a database provided by
the rightsholders. They also tend to use the Copyright Match Tool, which
are to find reuploads and a manual DMCA webform for reporting.

If Content ID flags a video, then YouTube may block it, mute it,
restrict it and also redirect monetization to the copyright owner. If a
rightsholder files a DMCA removal request, the video is then taken down,
and the uploader gets a copyright strike.

The appeals process would look like the creators disputing a Content ID
claim, and the rightsholder must respond within 30 days. Then appeal if
the claim is upheld. But, if the rightsholder escalates to a DMCA
takedown, the creator may file a counter notification. And if
successful, the video is reinstated and the strike is then removed.

Through the content ID, the rightsholders can monetize videos that use
their copyrighted material. Revenue typically goes to the copyright
owner, not the uploader, unless the the uploader wins a dispute
qualified under fair use.

YouTube offers the Content ID licensing agreements for major
rightsholders, which allows automated blocking, tracking, or
monetization. And they also have the copyright match tool for creators
to find unauthorized reuploads of their content.

## Fair Use Experiments

#### For this part of the experiment, I uploaded two versions of the same copyrighted performance ("Tate McRae -- greedy (Acoustic Live Performance)"). One was a [short 7-second clip](https://youtu.be/td3zRpy4VsQ?si=0MrUX6Sn4f8ATLgp), and the other was a [longer 57-second clip](https://youtu.be/S4TOnWmQKKc?si=st_qQUfnUBcj6MQn). Both were uploaded without modification to test how YouTube's Content ID responds to raw copyrighted material of different lengths.

The shorter clip had immediate content ID match, and also copyrighted
claimed. The Video stays up, but the monetization redirected, but no
major restrictions. This was done within minutes of uploading.

The longer clip had immediate content ID match, a copyright warning on
the video, and also an email notice. This video was blocked in 1
territory, but the video remains online -- region blocked. The email was
sent within 5 minutes of uploading the video.

## AI-Generated Content Investigation

#### VEED

#### AI Prompt: Generate a music video in the style of taylor swift's I can do it with a broken heart

#### AI generated Output:![A screenshot of a video chat Description automatically generated](ai_video%231.png)


#### I uploaded this as a YouTube short, and no violations were found. There were no Content ID matches, since I am assuming music and visuals were AI generated.

#### 

#### 

#### DeeVid AI

#### AI Prompt: can you create a music video 30 seconds in the style of tate mcrae\'s greedy

#### AI generated output:

#### ![](ai_video%232upload.png)

#### I uploaded this on YouTube and even if the video has the AI watermark, nothing happened. There were no Content ID matches, since I am assuming music and visuals were AI generated.

#### For both of the AI tools I used, VEED and DeeVid allows users to own the output that was generated. Both services prohibit generating direct copyrighted material (exact songs, characters, or footage).They emphasize that AI outputs must be original and not copies of existing works

#### The user that generated the videos would own the rights. AI companies do not claim ownership. Creators of training data do not gain rights over your outputs. In some legal systems, AI-generated work may not qualify for traditional copyright protection, but the services still assign usage rights to you.

YouTube allows AI-generated videos. AI content is treated like any other
upload under Content ID. AI videos only get flagged if they contain
copyrighted audio or video, not simply because they resemble a style. No
flags occurred because both videos used original AI-generated sounds and
visuals**.**

## Legal Analysis

## **Short Clip (7 seconds)**

### **1. Purpose and character**

- Purely reuploaded, not transformative → weighs against fair use.

- Non-commercial use helps slightly, but not enough.

### **2. Nature of the work**

- Highly creative music performance → weighs against fair use.

### **3. Amount used**

- Only 7 seconds, but it includes the "heart" of the performance
  (audio + visuals) → slightly against fair use.

### **4. Effect on the market**

- Very small impact due to short length and low visibility → slightly
  against or neutral.

Overall: Not transformative → unlikely fair use.\
YouTube treated it exactly this way: allowed but claimed/monetized by
SME.

## 

## **Long Clip (57 seconds)**

### **1. Purpose and character**

- Direct copy with no commentary or transformation → against fair use.

### **2. Nature of the work**

- Creative musical performance → against fair use.

### **3. Amount used**

- Nearly a full minute of the original work → strongly against fair use.

### **4. Effect on the market**

- A much longer clip is more likely to substitute for the original →
  against fair use.

Overall: Even weaker fair-use argument than the short clip.\
YouTube reinforced this by blocking it in one territory and applying a
stricter Content ID claim.

## **Gap Analysis** 

### **1. Legal Theory (copyright law)**

Under copyright law, neither of my uploads would qualify as fair use
because they were not transformed in any meaningful way. They were
simple copies of a creative work with no added commentary or new
purpose, which almost always fails the fair use test.

### **2. Platform Policy (YouTube)**

YouTube explains that Content ID will automatically scan every upload
and detect copyrighted audio or video. When this happens, the copyright
owner can choose to block the video, mute it, or collect the ad revenue.
A copyright strike only occurs if the copyright owner submits a formal
DMCA takedown request.

### **3. Actual Enforcement (What happened)**

Both of my uploads were detected immediately, which shows that Content
ID is functioning the way YouTube describes. I did not receive any
copyright strikes, which fits with their policy for Content ID claims.
The longer clip received a stricter response because it was blocked in
one region, while the shorter clip was simply claimed. YouTube did not
evaluate whether my uploads could qualify as fair use because the system
automatically enforced the copyright owner's preferences without
considering the legal details.
